Hardware info:
Device has i2c eeprom with marking "4G64" at address 0b10100000 with 64 Kbits, 32 pages, 8192 pagesize.
Eeprom programmer ch341a can read and write this eeprom, but only in desoldered state, since the main ic protection diodes interfere with reading.
Eeprom is used by the main ic with 1.8V, but can be programmed out of circuit with 3.3V.
The addresses used by the bluetooth protocol do not correspond directely to eeprom addresses.
bt read 0x10 bytes at addr 0x000 = Eeprom read 0x10 bytes at 0x050 (device id)
bt read 0x26 bytes at addr 0x260 = Eeprom read 0x26 bytes at 0x061 (setting read)
bt read 0x0e bytes at addr 0x2ac = Eeprom read 0x0e bytes at 0x0ad (first record of user1)
bt read 0x0e bytes at addr 0x6D8 = Eeprom read 0x0e bytes at 0x4d9 (first record of user2)

Difference between M700 intelli it and M500:
- different soldering positions for 100Ohm pullup / pulldown resistors close to "ic6 con"
- missing bluetooth module for m500, connected over 8 pin flat flex cable
- eeprom byte 0x74 (M500: 0x08 vs M700: 0x74), enables pairing / bluetooth button functionality
- eeprom bytes 0x50-0x60, reported device id / name over bluetooth, present for m700, 0xff for m500

I2C connector on bottom of the board:
GY: Eeprom Clock, also connected to main processor!
BL: Eeprom Data, also connected to main processor!
BK: EEprom Vss GND, connected to all ic's on the board!
R:  EEprom Vcc 1.8V, connected to all ic's on the board!
- could theoretically be used to read out records on m500 without bluetooth functionality by sniffing writes from the main ic
